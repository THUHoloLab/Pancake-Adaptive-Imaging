# Pancake-Adaptive-Imaging

## Overview

This work presents a neural Pancake camera that combines folded catadioptric optics
with an adaptive latent manifold prior for high-perceptual-quality imaging.
The proposed system enables compact, large-field-of-view, and high-perceptual-quality
imaging for mobile and edge-device applications.
